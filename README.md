### Motivation
- There are plenty of analytical write-ups on predicting prices of public housing sales (especially the Boston public housing dataset). However, I have not really come across any projects describing the private property market.

### Details
- In this project, I worked on exploring and predicting the rental prices in the private property market (specifically condominiums in Singapore)
- There are 3 parts to this project, namely:
 - Data acquisition (use of web scrapping) to curate data related to condominium rental
 - Data pre-processing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to analyze and identify trends in the condominium rental market
 - Prediction of rental price with 5 different ML models i.e. Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost Regressor, LightGBM Regressor, and CatBoost Regressor
 
### Value of Project
- This project is an end-to-end endeavour, starting from the beginning where web scrapping was utilized to acquire data, all the way to running machine learning models to predict  rental prices. 
- There is a lack of projects analyzing the private property market, in particular the market of condominium rentals in Singapore. This project serves to address this gap.
- Insights of the condominium rental market are visualized and explained, and detailed codes of all the steps are included in the notebooks. In addition, I also demonstrated how to perform checks of the key assumptions of linear regression models, and described the general concepts of ensemble learning.
